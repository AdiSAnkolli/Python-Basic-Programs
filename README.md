Just some basic programs and loops


1) Finding out the Armstrong numbers within a given range...
Now what is an Armstrong Number? 
According to the definition, an Armstrong number is an 'n' digit number which is equal to the sum of nth powers of its digits.
Confused? Well, let's look at it with a suitable example.
Consider the number 153. As it is a 3 digit number, n=3.
Checking Armstrong condition, that is :-
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3
= 1 + 125 + 27
= 153..!!!
( Honestly, the code was way easier than the explanation!!!!)


2) Patterns:-
As simple and basic as it may be, you got to admit that patterns have their own flair!
Be it as simple as a Floyd's triangle, or a hollow triangle made from stars, it's fun. This is a very simple one which makes use of the for loop, to print a simple number triangle.
And well, speaking of patterns, it can also get as complex as 'rabbit hopping in the woods' animation!! (Do check that one out too!!!)


3) Factorial:-
Factorial of a positive integer is basically the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number, and is denoted by '!'.
There are 3 ways (possibly more) to calculate factorial of a number using python
(i) Recursion 
(ii) Iterative (using loop)
(iii) Direct function available in math library.
I've done all three ways in the same file for convinience.


4) Prime Numbers:-
Simple program to calculate prime numbers from a given range of numbers.
