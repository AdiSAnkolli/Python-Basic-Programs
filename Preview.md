1) Finding out the Armstrong numbers within a given range...
Now what is an Armstrong Number? 
According to the definition, an Armstrong number is an 'n' digit number which is equal to the sum of nth powers of its digits.
Confused? Well, let's look at it with a suitable example.
Consider the number 153. As it is a 3 digit number, n=3.
Checking Armstrong condition, that is :-
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3
= 1 + 125 + 27
= 153..!!!
( Honestly, the code was way easier than the explanation!!!!)
